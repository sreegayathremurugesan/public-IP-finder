PUBLIC IP FINDER:
Why ipify?
Ever needed to get your public IP address programmatically?
Maybe you're provisioning new cloud servers and need to know your IP -- maybe you're behind a corporate firewall and need to tunnel information -- whatever the reason: sometimes having a public IP address API is useful!

You should use ipify because:

1.You can use it without limit (even if you're doing millions of requests per minute.

2.It works flawlessly with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, so no matter what sort of technology you're using, there won't be issues.

3.It's always online and available, and its infrastructure is powered by Heroku, which means that regardless of whether the server running the API dies, or if there's an enormous tornado which destroys half of the east coast, ipify will still be running!

4.ipify is completely open source (check out the GitHub repository).

5.No visitor information is ever logged. Period.

6.Lastly, ipify is funded by Randall Degges, so there's no need to worry about the domain name disappearing in three years or anything like that: ipify is here to stay!
 
 This simple webpage using the ipify public API displays the public IP address of the client hitting the request from a remote location.
 Usage is so simple that simply renderring the html page on the browser would do the rest.
